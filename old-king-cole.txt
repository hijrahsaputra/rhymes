Old King Cole
“Old King Cole” lyrics date back to the early 18th century England.

The first version was published around 1708 in William King’s work “Useful Transactions in Philosophy”.

The origin of King Cole character can be traced back to early history. “Cole” is a derived name from the Brythonic “Coel”. The character was related to some legendary names in British History, all identified as King Coel and mostly mentioned in British legends and literature.

One of those figures was Coel Hen, also nicknamed, Coel the Old or Old King Cole because of his age. He was the King of Northern Britain during the decline of the Roman Empire when Britain was assailed by the Goths and exempt by the Romans.

Another legendary figure in Britain’s History was Coel Godhebog, a predecessor of Coel Hen, known as Cole the Magnificent.
